# Dynamic Form Builder (Minimal)

This is a minimal, working React + TypeScript + Redux (RTK) project that implements:
- Create dynamic forms with fields and validations
- Preview a form (validate inputs)
- Save form schema to localStorage
- Derived fields (basic formula using parent labels as variables)

## Run locally

1. npm install
2. npm run dev
3. Open http://localhost:5173

Notes:
- Keep UI minimal (MUI used)
- This is intentionally simple and readable for assignment submission
